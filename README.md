## Hi there,
 I'm B. Haze
- **Current Role:** None
- **Status**: Open for Collaboration

👋 I currently have around 4k hours in Arma 3. Most of my time is spent as a member of different milsim units. This account is to help with a variety of technical projects in the A3 community.

⚔️ I've spent most of my time in the US special operations Arma 3 milsim community in units ranging from 75th RR and Special Forces to NSWDG and Delta Force. I've held a variety of positions from grunt to unit owner. 
My biggest lessons learned have been that egos kill units, be a sponge of knowledge, and to share what you know.
